    TODO: 4.12. Write the Java code to display the error message present in the request object. The
    error message should be displayed below the Sign In and Sing Up buttons. These error messages
    will be set inside the UserServlet. There can be multiple error messages such as
    "No user registered with the given email address!" when a user tries to log in using an
    email address which is not registered in the database. The java code should be able to print
    all such kinds of error messages.
